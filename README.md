# video_style_transfer
A style transfer for videos based on Gatys' paper.

I used PyTorch and Google Colab (a lot of time due to timeouts), and I encourage you to apply different style images and videos.

If you find this repo useful, please ping me so we can have a cup of coffee if you ever come to my city.
